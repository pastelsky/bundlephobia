## Bundlephobia

Know the performance impact of including an npm package in your app's bundle.

## Getting started locally
 -  Use `yarn run dev` to debug the frontend
 - Use `yarn start` to run production build and test along with the server backend (no hot compilation yet!)
 - [Optional] Add a `.env` file to the root with firebase credentials for caching to work.
  
  ```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=<apiKey>
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<domain>
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=<url>
  ```
