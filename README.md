## FAQ

#### 1. Why does search for package X throw `MissingDependencyError` ?

This error is thrown if a package `require`s a dependency without adding it in its depdencies or peerDependencies list. In the absence of such a definition, we cannot reliably report the size of the package - since we cannot resolve any information about the package.

In such a case, it's best to report an issue with the package author asking the missing package to be added to its `package.json`

#### 2. I see a `BuildError` for package X, but I'm not sure why.

You can see a detailed stack trace in your devtools console, and [open an issue](https://github.com/pastelsky/bundlephobia/issues/new) with the relevant details. Working on a more ideal solution for this.
