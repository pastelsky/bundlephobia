Thanks for looking to help ðŸ‘‹. Have a nice time contributing to bundlephobia.
If you've any queries regarding setup or contributing, feel free to open an issue. 
I'll try my best to answer as soon as I can.

Note: This repository only contains the frontend, and the request server. 
If you're looking to make changes to the core logic â€“ building of packages and size calculation, you need to look here instead - [package-build-stats](https://github.com/pastelsky/package-build-stats)

## Running locally
### Adding the necessary keys
Add a `.env` file to the root with Algolia credentials. The server should still run without this, but some features might be disabled.
  
  ```ini
# App Id for NPM Registry
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=OFCNCOG2CU

# API Key
ALGOLIA_API_KEY=<api-key-obtained-from-algolia>
```

In addition, one can specify - 
```ini
BUILD_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=<endpoint-to-service>
```
In the absence of such an endpoint, packages will be built locally using the [`getPackageStats` function](https://github.com/pastelsky/package-build-stats)
and 

  ```ini
CACHE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=<endpoint-to-service>

FIREBASE_API_KEY=<apiKey>
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<domain>
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=<url>
  ```
  for caching to work (optional).
